### 👾 What I learned

What I learned in this project is that in group work, I experienced again being part of the group and working harmoniously in the group. I learned how to combine a project if it is developed by several developers. I also learned that when designing, you should definitely think about the design for the developers, not for the design. In addition, I learned that I can use `position absolute` in a comfortable way by giving `position relative` to its parent.

CSS Code Snippet:

```css
.card-component {
  position: relative;
}

.card-component .gradient {
  position: absolute;
}
```

### 💪 Continued development

Of course, I don't want to leave this project this way, I want to move forward with our friends by adding more innovations. Now we are on JavaScript with our teacher Alptuğ Türkiş. In the following process, we will pull data to Quizzo and make a real quiz application. So stay tuned!!!
